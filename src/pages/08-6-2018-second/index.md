When you go on sites like [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) or any other place where developers, experienced and novice alike, congregate, there is a ripe oppurtunity to have your self-esteem smashed. Not because people are cruel or overly-critical (although sometimes there is some of that, these communities are pretty good at policing bullies), but because it's intimidating to see just how talented people are or how much there is left to learn. 

We work on our projects, we err, and err, and err again, then we get our big win! Our stylesheet is finally linked properly or our fetch request is returning 200. We are overcome with feelings of accomplishment and joy!

...then we look online. 

Soon we find out that there are things like JavaScript frameworks, or that those awesome fonts and icons are dramatically decreasing your site's performance, or that no one in these communities will likely give your site the time of day if it's not responsive, or that..., or that... We read about all these things we have no idea about and learn that because we are not implementing those things we are terrible people who are clogging up the internet with garbage.

## You don't know until you know
I was so naive when I first started learning to program. I remember creating an HTML document in Notepad where I changed the color of an h1 containing my name and feeling as though I was ready to apply to programming jobs &mdash; *I wrote something that I can open in Chrome, I am invincible!* 

Of course this is humorous when one considers what it takes to land a developer job, but it reflects that people who don't study programming are completely clueless about this stuff. Generating something that is rendered in a browser elicits a powerful feeling &mdash; somehow, through your keystrokes, you made something that is now a part of the most important information tool ever created. To your friends and family who know nothing about coding you are some sort of technical guru who can "build an app," when in reality you just got off the blocks.


It's not until people look to broaden their knowledge that the iceberg is uncovered and a strong wave of fear washes over the body. But that's the fun of it! So where do you find this iceberg?

## Be where the knowledge is
**1. Reddit**

   This is my favorite resource, specifically *r/webdev*, *r/web_design*, *r/learnprogramming*, *r/cscareerquestions8*

**2. Stackoverflow**

I typically acess Stackoverflow through google.

## It will get better and faster (not just your websites)

It's sort of an odd feeling that occurs once you get into a routine of learning new tech on your own. Over time you notice that the learning becomes quicker, that you start seeing patterns that make debugging easier, and, ultimately, that reading about something you've never heard of before is now an opportunity to grow versus an agozining reminder of your incompetence. 

The shift occurs because learning new things in tech is really a lot of the same. Once you have a solid amount of experience building things, breaking things, and fixing what breaks your builds, it becomes easier &mdash; not easy but easier &mdash; to learn how new tech integrates into your existing body of knowledge.


## "But I'm not as good as ..."

Thus the quote at the top of the page. I must admit, sometimes when I look at the projects that people post on reddit, I am completely disenheartened. How could a single person create such an elaborate project? I would disregard all the knowledge I accrued and things I've built and hyperfocus on the what this person did &mdash; of course, this isn't a very healthy practice.

Two things to keep in mind, though:

1. **A large portion of the Reddit community is pretty advanced/experienced**
    
    Though the subreddits like *r/webdev* and *r/learnprogramming* have hundreds of thousands subscribers, there's typically only a thousand or so visitors online at any given time.  

    For instance, these screenshots were taken on a Sunday evening.

    ![r/webdev visitors](https://i.imgur.com/SGhgc6zm.jpg) ![r/learnprogramming visitors](https://i.imgur.com/vGVqllAm.jpg)
    
     I interpret these numbers as demonstrating that, though a lot of people may show a passing interest in programming, the actual number of people who contribute content and are active in these communities is relatively small. This is a good thing, though, because you will be exposed to immense knowledge and creativity. However, the standard will be high and, especially if you're brand new to coding, nearly everyone will be much, much better than you at this.

     Also, take a look at the github repos of the people whose projects get upvoted on reddit. Sometimes I'll get overwhelmed at how amazing someone's project is, only to view this person's github and see eight years of contributions. I think it's safe to assume someone whose been doing this for eight years will be better than someone whose been doing this for eleven months.
    
2. **Some people are prodigys, but most aren't**

    And that's okay. It's annoying, but okay. 


## Final Thoughts

I'm still a n00bmeister-400 myself, so I hope all my advice here is taken with a grain of salt. That said, I have been paid by someone to program and I did graduate as a research scholar in psychology, so I think I can provide some interesting insights into this *learning to program* discussion.

The biggest key, as with all learning, is how interested someone is in the topic at hand. I think if you love developing and building things, then getter better will just be a matter of how much time you put into this. Of course, one can't do so in a vacuum &mdash; it's important to be where the knowledge is and to stay up to date &mdash; but if you're getting feedback and challenging yourself, you should be moving forward.

I think a lot of the questions on learning this stuff are from people who don't understand that there isn't some bootcamp or tutorial that will give you all you need to be even mildly-mediocre at programming. Practically all learning occurs incrementally over a period of time, not all at once very quickly &mdash; this is especially so with programming.
