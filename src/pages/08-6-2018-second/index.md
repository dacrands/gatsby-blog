When you go on sites like [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) or any other place where developers -- experienced and novice alike -- congregate, there is a ripe oppurtunity to have your self-esteem smashed. Not because people are cruel or overly-critical (although sometimes there is some of that, these communities are pretty good at policing bullies), but because it's intimidating to see just how talented people are or how much there is left to learn. 

We work on our projects, we err, and err, and err again, then we get our big win! Our stylesheet is finally linked properly or our fetch request is returning 200. We are overcome with feelings of accomplishment and joy...then we look online. Soon we find out that apparently EJS is out and React is in, or that you need to minify and lazy-load your assets, or that those awesome fonts and icons are dramatically decreasing your site's performance, or that no one in these communities will likely give your site the time of day if it's not responsive, or that..., or that... We read about all these things we have no idea about and learn that because we are not implementing those things we are terrible people who are clogging up the internet with garbage.

### You don't know until you know

I was so naive when I first started learning to program. I remember creating an HTML document in Notepad where I changed the color of an h1 containing my name and feeling as though I was ready to apply to programming jobs -- *I wrote something that I can open in Chrome, I am invincible!* 

Of course this is humorous when one considers what it takes to land a developer job, but it reflects that people who don't study programming are completely clueless about this stuff. Generating something that is rendered in a browser elicits a powerful feeling; this feeling gives people a false sense of accomplishment precisely because the internet is so enigmatic. It's not until people look to broaden their knowledge that the iceberg is uncovered, time spent googling things like closures and inheritance increases, and time spent socializing decreases. ![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Iceberg_in_the_Arctic_with_its_underside_exposed.jpg/1200px-Iceberg_in_the_Arctic_with_its_underside_exposed.jpg) 


### It will get better and faster (not just your websites)

It's sort of an odd feeling that occurs once you get into a routine of learning new tech on your own. Over time you notice that the learning becomes quicker, that you start seeing patterns that make debugging easier, and, ultimately, that reading about something you've never heard of before is now an opportunity to grow versus an agozining reminder of your incompetence. 

The shift occurs because learning new things in tech is really a lot of the same. Once you have a solid amount of experience building things, breaking things, and fixing what breaks your builds, it becomes second-nature to learn how new tech integrates into your existing body of knowledge.


### "But I'm not as good as ..."

Thus the quote at the top of the page. Sometimes when I look at the projects that people posted on reddit, I am completely disenheartened. How could a single person create such an elaborate project? I would disregard all the knowledge I accrued and things I've built and hyperfocus on the what this person did. One thing I began doing, however, was looking a bit into these individuals' histories, specifically their git histories.

What I found was that the people who create amazing projects often have years of programming experience. They have been aware of this community for years, whereas I am a newbie just starting out. Like many things, experience and insecurity are inversely related in programming.
