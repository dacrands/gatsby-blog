File-hosting. 


From an entrepreneurial perspective, creating a file hosting application is a probably a complete waste of time. With *Google Drive* and *Dropbox,* who are able to offer gigs of storage for free, competition in this space seems quite tough.

But I'm not an entrepreneur, I'm a developer. As such, I created a simple file hosting application using Flask, and I am glad I did.


## The App
---
Once users authenticate their account, they may upload files with the following extensions:


| Office | Images | Other |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| docx | jpg  | pdf  |
| xlsx | png  | txt  |
| ppt  | gif  |      |

These file extensions reflect what I would typically keep on Google drive, Dropbox, or a USB drive. As we will see, modifying what files the user can and can't upload is extremely simple, so this list is subject to change.
